<p>Iâ€™m a technical person, but lately I found that tech leadership is interesting. Originally, I was a computer science programmer and technology engineer for ten+ years(started at 14). I changed my interests a little, since those days, after joining the industry a few years ago. I find that although technical knowledge is important, soft skills are vastly underutilized by technical people. When I realized the latter, I soon came interested in how technology and leadership could function together.
In the meantime, I still create and find fascinating building software and more recently machine learning and deep learning models. I hope one day Iâ€™m able to have the opportunity to seal the gap between the technical and non-technical domains. Until then, I have fun sharing computer science, AI, engineering, and other technical topics contemporaneous to our time(2010&gt;).</p>
